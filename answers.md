## Part 3: Making Change

After completing a tortuous semester of Algorithms, you decide to take a much needed vacation. You arrive in a city called Geometrica, and head to the bank to
exchange $N$ dollars for local currency. In Geometrica they have a
currency that is 1-1 with U.S. Dollars, but they only have
coins. Moreover the coins are in
denominations of powers of $2$ (e.g., $k$ denominations of values $2^0$, $2^1$, \ldots,
$2^k$). You wonder why they have
such strange denominations. You think about it a while, and because
you had such a good Algorithms instructor, you realize that there is a
very clever reason. 

- **3a.** Given a $N$ dollars, state a greedy algorithm for producing
as few coins as possible that sum to $N$.

  - So, we can look for the largest number of k that $2^k$ is less than or equal to the N, in this case if we subtract the value form N $\to N' = N-2^k$ then we can repeat this process untill the N' = 0. In other words, if we look at the binary representation of N then the number of position having element 1 shows the number and values of the coins we should get.
